The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).
The initial-scale=1 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
The .container class provides a responsive fixed width container
The .container-fluid class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport


GRID SYSTEM
.col-xs- .col-sm- .col-md- .col-lg-
xs (for phones - screens less than 768px wide)
sm (for tablets - screens equal to or greater than 768px wide)
md (for small laptops - screens equal to or greater than 992px wide)
lg (for laptops and desktops - screens equal to or greater than 1200px wide)
Some Bootstrap grid system rules:
Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element
In the example below, we only specify the .col-md-6 class (without .col-sm-*). This means that medium and large devices will split 50%/50% - because the class scales up. However, for small devices, it will stack vertically (100% width)


TYPOGRAPHY
Bootstrap's global default font-size is 14px, with a line-height of 1.428.
This is applied to the <body> element and all paragraphs (<p>).
In addition, all <p> elements have a bottom margin that equals half their computed line-height (10px by default).
tags - <h1>to<h6>, <small>, <mark>, <abbr>, <blockquote>, <code>, <kbd>, <pre>

Class	Description	Example
.lead	Makes a paragraph stand out	
.small	Indicates smaller text (set to 85% of the size of the parent)	
.text-left	Indicates left-aligned text	
.text-center	Indicates center-aligned text	
.text-right	Indicates right-aligned text	
.text-justify	Indicates justified text	
.text-nowrap	Indicates no wrap text	
.text-lowercase	Indicates lowercased text	
.text-uppercase	Indicates uppercased text	
.text-capitalize	Indicates capitalized text	
.initialism	Displays the text inside an <abbr> element in a slightly smaller font size	
.list-unstyled	Removes the default list-style and left margin on list items (works on both <ul> and <ol>). This class only applies to immediate children list items (to remove the default list-style from any nested lists, apply this class to any nested lists as well)	
.list-inline	Places all list items on a single line	
.dl-horizontal	Lines up the terms (<dt>) and descriptions (<dd>) in <dl> elements side-by-side. Starts off like default <dl>s, but when the browser window expands, it will line up side-by-side	
.pre-scrollable	Makes a <pre> element scrollable

ALERTS
- Dismissible Alerts
To help improve accessibility for people using screen readers, you should include the aria-label="close" attribute, when creating a close button.
&times; (Ã—) is an HTML entity that is the preferred icon for close buttons, rather than the letter "x".
<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible">
  <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
  <strong>Success!</strong> Indicates a successful or positive action.
</div>
- Alerts with Links
<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>Success!</strong> You should <a href="#" class="alert-link">read this message</a>.
</div>
-Animated Alerts

BUTTONS
You can use button classes on <a>, <button>, and <input> 
Bootstrap uses the non-standard (at the time of writing) pointer-events: none to disable link buttons (those buttons created with the <a> element). Although this works in many cases, it doesn't work in all cases. Therefore, you should also use JavaScript to disable any link button functionality (or just use a <button> element if you can).
Since we do not have any page to link it to, and we do not want to get a "404" message, we put # as the link in our examples. It should be a real URL to a specific page.
